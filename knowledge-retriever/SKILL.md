  "look up", "search for", "what does X do", "how does Y work", "get context on".

# Knowledge Retriever

Retrieve and synthesize information from internal documentation and the web.

## When to use

Activate this skill when the user needs to:

- Find specific information in internal docs, runbooks, or ADRs
- Research current best practices, library versions, or external APIs
- Get context on a system, service, or concept before making a change
- Summarize or compare multiple sources on a topic

## How to use this skill

### 1. Check internal documentation first (Notion)

Always start with Notion for anything that may be org-specific:

```
notion.search({ query: "<topic>" })
notion.retrieve_page({ page_id: "<id>" })
notion.retrieve_block_children({ block_id: "<id>" })
```

Prefer Notion results for:
- Team processes, architecture decisions, on-call runbooks
- Internal API contracts and environment configs
- Any topic where the org's decision overrides generic advice

### 2. Use Codex web search for external information

Use your built-in web search for anything not covered by internal docs:

- Open-source library documentation and changelogs
- Industry best practices and standards (RFCs, OWASP, etc.)
- Recent news or announcements (releases, deprecations, CVEs)

## Synthesis guidelines

1. **Check Notion first** — internal decisions override generic advice
2. **Fall back to web search** when internal docs are silent or outdated
3. **Cite sources** in your response: Notion page title + URL, or web result URL
4. **Resolve conflicts** by preferring the more recent source, noting the discrepancy

## Setup

The `notion` MCP uses OAuth — run `codex mcp login notion` once to authenticate.
